                    <p> One of the first instances of Computer Graphics were made by William A Fetter. Fetter was the creator of the first computer model of a human body, marking the
                        beginning of its development.  
                    </p>
    
                    <p> In the 1960s, Ivan Sutherland invented the SketchPad. This device was able to structure geometric objects and could be altered with a lightpen.
                        Early developmnts of Computer Graphics were primarily made for research, but over time its utility began to branch out.
