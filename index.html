                    <p> On your devices, there are interactive elements that you have within applications such as images, videos, animations, etc. These are computer graphics,
                        which is also known as CG. There is a process through instruction and renders using your computer in order for these graphics to appear on your screen. 
                        These graphics are used to incorporate style into an application to make it appealing and unique.
                    </p>
                    <p> Computer Graphcis is not only a topic of design, but it also has concepts relating to Computer Science. Mathematics and physics come into play to understand
                        how to work out motion, vectors within 3D models, and more. Programming languages such as Javascript and Graphics Libraries are necessary to implement this logic. These tools work together to 
                        manipulate digital information into amazing visuals necessary for an attractive application.
