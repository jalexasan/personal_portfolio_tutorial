                        Within a user interface, users will interact with buttons, windows, images, and other objects. A program can easily communicate and provide for the user
                        when its functions are translated clearly through those objects. Now, the user can navigate through applications smoothly without a problem.

                        <summary > Animation  </summary>
                        Animation programs help create and produce animated film and animated effects in television shows, videos games, advertisements, and other kinds of media. 
                        3D models are made within vector graphics and use an axis for placement. Certain algorithms provided by the programs themselves assist animations by predicting
                        in-between frames, saving production time.

                        <summary > Visualization  </summary>
                        Visualization is used to interpret a ray data and output a visual representation for a user's understanding. These visuals can include pie charts, heat maps,
                        histograms, and scatter plots. In result, a user can record that data and examine it more closely for trends. The data recorded can help users make conclusions
                        or predictions according to information received.
